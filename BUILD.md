# Building the system

To build the MinC Unix emulator for Windows you need the 
OpenBSD 6.1.0 source code and MinGW:

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

I pulled the OpenBSD source code from the read-only GitHub 
repository. There is an article which explains how to pull 
the source for a specific version, but you will need the 
CVS software:

* https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html

However, you can also use my copy (186Mb):

* https://minc.commandlinerevolution.nl/openbsd-master-6.1.0.zip

**Note**: create a folder in the root of a diskdrive, named 
'source'. Move the .ZIP file there and extract it.

## Step 1: set up a simple cross-compiler

To build the new kernel and compile the operating system code, 
you would have to build an OpenBSD cross compiler first. This 
can be very laborious and frustrating. If you want to know more 
about cross-compiling, watch Rob Landley's excellent presentation 
on the topic:

* https://youtu.be/Sk9TatW9ino

Instead we will create an isolated, slightly modified instance 
of the MinGW compiler. Let's call it a *poor man's cross-compiler*. 
Your current MinGW installation will be left completely 
untouched.

Open the MSYS terminal, **cd** to your *minc-devel* directory 
and make the *opt* target. All files will be installed in a 
newly created directory, called */opt/minc*:

	make opt

**Note**: you will probably get some error messages here. These 
will guide you to properly set up the 'config.inc' file. Use 
vim to edit it and define the indicated variables.

## Step 2: build a minimal OpenBSD system

The kernel will be built using a combination of vanilla MinGW and 
our *poor man's cross-compiler*, residing in */opt/minc/cross*. 
To test if this all works, make the kernel first:

	make kernel

A minimal system consists of the kernel, the BSD C library, the 
boot program, the Korn shell and some utilities. These will be 
built by the new system itself. To finish the build:

	make system

You now have a working OpenBSD system, but we are still using 
the MSYS commands. To make sure we are using our brand new 
OpenBSD binaries, you will need to mount the */opt/minc* 
directory. This is done by running the **mount** script:

	./mount.sh minc

To test if the new system works, you can run the **uname** command:

	uname -a

The result should be similar to the following output:

	OpenBSD dimension.sassenheim.dmz 6.1.0 MINC#20250720 i386

**Note**: if you want back to compiling Windows programs, simply 
re-mount the */mingw* directory:

	./mount.sh mingw

## Step 3: install the system

For this step, you need to be Administrator. Close the MSYS 
terminal and open it again as Administrator. Change to your 
*minc-devel* directory and and run the **install** target:

	make install

**Note**: By default, MinC will be installed in the 
**C:\minc-release** directory. If you want another install 
location, uncomment and change the 'DESTDIR' variable 
in config.inc. It is not advisable to create the MinC root 
directory in a location like *Program Files*. File permissions 
in this kind of location are unsuitable for OpenBSD to run 
properly.

To finalize step 3, go to the new folder in Windows Exporer and 
open the *sbin* folder. There should be a program named *bsd.exe*.
Right-click it and run it as Administrator. You will see the 
following message:

	open(/dev/console): No such file or directory
	/bin/ksh: No controlling tty (open /dev/tty: No such file or directory)
	/bin/ksh: warning: won't have full job control

This is because there is no */dev* file system yet. To create it,
along with some of the other system directories like */home* and 
*/tmp*, run the **setup** script:

	/sbin/setup.sh

When it is finished, you can close the window and open it again 
by double-clicking. The above message should be gone.

Double-clicking the *bsd.exe* program is not the right way to 
start the MinC terminal. To make it start properly and in your 
home directory, put following lines in a file named 
*minc-release.cmd* on your Desktop:

	@ECHO OFF
	
	CD C:\minc-release\sbin
	START "MinC" bsd.exe -h

The *START* command tells the console to read console settings from
the Windows Registry. The *-h* switch tells MinC to change to 
your */home* directory.

**Note**: the root folder you created seems to have disappeared.
This is because when MinC mounts its root directory, it hides the 
directory from view in Windows Explorer. This is super important 
for preventing recursive directory listings. It is also standard 
practice in Windows for mounted drives. If you want to access 
the MinC root folder in Windows Explorer, just exit the console 
or type its location in the address bar, like *C:\minc-release*.

## Step 4: building the GCC compiler

This is currently not within the scope of this document.
