# MinC Is Not Cygwin

MinC was written to help children at vocational education learn Linux without the 
hassle of virtualization.

MinC is a tiny kernel emulation (285Kb) which runs on Windows. The rest of the software was 
taken from OpenBSD, version 6.1. This means that by installing MinC, you run OpenBSD 
on your Windows machine at native speed.

To build MinC from scratch you need the MinGW GCC build tools. It is not advisable 
to attempt this at the moment. The build process is not yet fully automated.
