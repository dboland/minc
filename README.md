# MinC Is Not Cygwin

MinC was written to help children at vocational education learn Linux without the 
hassle of virtualization.

It contains a small kernel which runs on Windows. The rest of the software was 
taken from OpenBSD, version 6.1. This means that by installing MinC, you run OpenBSD 
on your Windows machine!
